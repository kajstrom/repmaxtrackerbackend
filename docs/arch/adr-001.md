**Title**: ADR 1: Implement Domain Logic as Transaction Scripts

**Context**: The Domain Logic in this application is not too complicated and is mostly statistic oriented.

**Decision**: Domain Logic will be implemented as Transaction Scripts in "domain" package.

**Status**: accepted

**Consequences**: Handling of database intensive functionality should be relatively easy to implement.
Domain objects will be DTO natured anemic domain objects, they're mostly just used to transfer data to the
presentation layer and will not hold any domain logic. More complicated domain logic might be hard to implement.
